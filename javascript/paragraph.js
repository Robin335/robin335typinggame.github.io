      'Robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks traditionally done by human beings. Robots are widely used in industries such as automobile manufacture to perform simple repetitive tasks, and in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots may be equipped with human-like senses such as vision and touch.',
      'Whereas virtual reality replaces your vision, augmented reality adds to it. AR devices like the Microsoft HoloLens are transparent, allowing you to see everything in front of you while adding digital elements to your view.',
      'This technology has a distinct disadvantage compared with virtual reality: visual immersion. While VR covers your entire field of vision, AR only projects images in a limited area.'
